    "### Analysis of Py District Schools\n",
    "   >* OBSERVATION 1: The smaller the school size, the better overall pass performance. Better overall pass performance may also be correlated to school _type_ since the Charter schools are generally smaller than the District schools. It would be nice to look into if smaller schools have a lower student-teacher ratio than the larger school, as could be assumed, but this is a limitation of the current data where faculty size is not provided.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   >* OBSERVATION 2: There is no correlation between per student budget and greater performance. This is likely because the per student budget variance is not significant across schools. The spread is under $100. If the set were larger, say all the districts in the state, perhaps the results would vary.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   >* OBSERVATION 3: There is not a material difference in results per grade by school for either the math scores or the reading scores. Said differently, average passing rates by subject, across grades within an individual school, are fairly stable. Based on this, there may need to be an audit of either the base subject curriculums or subject department leadership."
